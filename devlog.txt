Devlog Rules:
Devlog allows any group member at any time to see the current state of the project.
PM will make sure devlog is being maintained, but will not make all entries.
When any team member stops working and pushes changes to github, they should update the devlog explaining what changes have been made. Include errors/bugs discovered (or created).
Separate devlog entries with a newline.
Most recent entry at the bottom.
Each entry should begin with the following format: firstL -- TIMESTAMP\n ( e.g.: topherM -- 1999-12-31 23:59 )

I've drawn and pushed the Greedy Toads flag! Believe it or not, my drawing tablet skills are improving... anyway, it's time for me to go work on the project design. :)

I made a branch 'create-page' which has the code for adding data from a form for creating a page to a table, 'data_subtopics' in a database, 'subtopics.db'. The function used for this is
called create-page() which involves functions from 'create.py', add_page_data() and _is_valid()	(the latter checking if the entry name already exists in the db). Currently just waiting 
on design doc to be approved before merging pull request for branch.

I made a branch 'add-create-renderpage' which has the code for create_story function which creates table in db based on form input from create.html, story_add which passes values from add.html form to story_add_helper, story_add_helper which adds a story_contrib to a table in the database and updates user_table with the fact that a user has worked on something new, and render_story which renders create.html, add.html, or renders story.html with the necessary values based on boolean inputs from the html.
Not ready to be pushed into main until further testing of everything.
